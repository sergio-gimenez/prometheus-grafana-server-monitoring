# Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring Stack for Linux Servers

Simple Plug-and-play Linux Server Monitoring Prometheus and Grafana Stack.

Just run `docker-compose up` and you are good to go.

## After Installation

In order to enable visualisation of the metrics, just choose a dashboard from Grafana's dashboard library. You can find the dashboard library [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards). The dashboard with ID `1860` does the job for me.
